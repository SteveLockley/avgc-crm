        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This Refund Policy applies to all payments made to Alnmouth Village Golf Club Ltd. through our website or at the clubhouse. We aim to be fair and reasonable in all refund requests.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Membership Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>
          Annual membership subscriptions are generally non-refundable once paid. However, we will consider refund requests on a case-by-case basis in exceptional circumstances, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Serious illness or injury preventing play for a prolonged period</li>
          <li>Relocation making continued membership impractical</li>
          <li>Bereavement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Any refund of membership subscriptions will be at the discretion of the club committee and may be calculated on a pro-rata basis from the date of the request.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Visitor Green Fees</h2>
        <p>
          Green fees paid in advance may be refunded or rescheduled in the following circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Course closure:</strong> If the course is closed on the day of your booking due to weather or maintenance, a full refund or alternative date will be offered.</li>
          <li><strong>Cancellation with notice:</strong> Cancellations made at least 24 hours before the booked tee time will receive a full refund.</li>
          <li><strong>Late cancellation:</strong> Cancellations made less than 24 hours before the booked tee time are non-refundable, unless due to exceptional circumstances.</li>
          <li><strong>No-show:</strong> Green fees for no-shows are non-refundable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Competition Entry Fees</h2>
        <p>
          Competition entry fees are non-refundable once the competition draw has been made. Cancellations before the draw will receive a full refund.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Other Payments</h2>
        <p>
          Refunds for other goods or services (such as clubhouse purchases or locker rental) will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Please contact the club office to discuss.
        </p>

        <h2>6. How to Request a Refund</h2>
        <p>
          To request a refund, please contact us by email or phone. Please include your name, the date and amount of payment, and the reason for your refund request.
