      <p>7.2 Alleged breaches of this Policy shall be dealt with using the Club's complaints, disciplinary or staff grievance procedure as appropriate.</p>

      <h2>Appendix One: The Equality Act 2010 and Discrimination</h2>

      <p>Every individual and organisation to whom this Policy applies must not act in a way which is directly or indirectly discriminatory and must make reasonable adjustments to avoid discriminating against anyone with a Protected Characteristic. Failure to do so will be considered a breach of this Policy, and may be a breach of the Equality Act 2010.</p>

      <p>The Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful to discriminate directly or indirectly against individuals or groups with certain "Protected Characteristics". The "Protected Characteristics" are listed in section 4 of the Act:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>Disability</li>
        <li>Gender Reassignment</li>
        <li>Marriage and Civil Partnership</li>
        <li>Pregnancy and Maternity</li>
        <li>Race</li>
        <li>Religion or Belief</li>
        <li>Sex</li>
        <li>Sexual Orientation</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Direct Discrimination</h3>

      <p>Direct Discrimination is defined at section 13(1) of the Equality Act 2010: <em>"A person (A) discriminates against another (B) if, because of a protected characteristic, A treats B less favourably than A treats or would treat others."</em></p>

      <p>For example, if an action or decision is taken by a club which treats females less favourably than males, this would be considered direct discrimination on the grounds of sex, which is a protected characteristic.</p>

      <h3>Indirect Discrimination</h3>

      <p>Indirect Discrimination is defined at section 19(1) of the Equality Act 2010: <em>"A person (A) discriminates against another (B) if A applies to B a provision, criterion or practice which is discriminatory in relation to a relevant protected characteristic of B's."</em></p>

      <p>Indirect discrimination occurs where less favourable treatment is not necessarily the main effect or objective of an action or decision.</p>

      <p>Since the nature of indirect discrimination is that the discriminatory effect is an unexpected or unforeseen effect of a good faith decision, complaints of indirect discrimination should therefore be considered carefully and objectively, and not dismissed out of hand purely because the effect was not an expected or intentional one.</p>

      <p>If, for example, a golf club introduces a rule that club competitions can only be played on Saturdays, this rule would prevent members with certain religious beliefs from taking part in the competition. Although it may not have been the intention of the golf club, the effect of the rule is the less favourable treatment of members on the grounds of religion or belief, which is a protected characteristic. This is indirect discrimination.</p>

      <h3>Actions and Intentions</h3>

      <p>An action or decision will still be considered discriminatory even if the less favourable treatment is unintentional. It may not always be obvious to the perpetrator that their actions are discriminatory. Indirect discrimination is often unintentional, but it is not a defence to an allegation of discrimination to say that the perpetrator did not mean to discriminate against a person or group. Discrimination can arise out of actions and decisions, but can also arise out of omissions and failure to take actions or decisions.</p>

      <h3>Reasonable Adjustments</h3>

      <p>Everybody to whom this Policy applies is under a duty to make reasonable adjustments to avoid discriminating against any individual or group with a Protected Characteristic.</p>

      <p>The duty is to make <em>reasonable</em> adjustments. It is not unreasonable for adjustments to cost time, money, or other resources. However, an adjustment may not be reasonable if the cost is disproportionately high, or making the adjustment would be unfeasible.</p>

      <h3>Positive Action</h3>

      <p>It can be lawful to make decisions that discriminate on the basis of a Protected Characteristic in very limited and exceptional circumstances, if the discrimination is a 'Positive Action' taken in order to address an underrepresented group or Protected Characteristic. Positive Actions must be reasonable, justifiable, and clearly linked to a legitimate aim.</p>

      <h3>Examples</h3>

      <p>In a golfing context, some examples of unlawful discrimination might include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Not allowing the use of golf buggies, as this increases the cost of maintaining the course;</li>
        <li>Restricting the number of tee times available to women during peak hours at a golf course;</li>
        <li>Not allowing competitions to be played on alternate days to accommodate for certain religious beliefs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Appendix Two: Harassment</h2>

      <p>Harassment is defined in section 26(1) of the Equality Act 2010. Harassment occurs where a person engages in unwanted conduct related to a Protected Characteristic, which has the purpose of either:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Violating the other person's dignity; or</li>
        <li>Creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for the other person.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In determining whether conduct amounts to harassment, regard is had to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The perception of the victim;</li>
        <li>Whether it is reasonable for the conduct to have the perceived effect; and</li>
        <li>The wider circumstances of the matter.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sexual Harassment</h3>

      <p>Sexual harassment occurs where a person engages in unwanted conduct of a sexual nature, and the conduct has the purpose or effects outlined above.</p>

      <h3>One Off Incidents</h3>

      <p>A single, isolated, or one-off incident can still amount to harassment. The key consideration is the purpose or effect of the conduct.</p>

      <h3>Protection from Harassment Act 1997</h3>

      <p>Harassment can still occur even if it is not based on a Protected Characteristic. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 made it a civil, and sometimes a criminal, offence to carry out a course of conduct that amounts to harassment.</p>

      <h3>Examples</h3>

      <p>In a golfing context, some examples of unlawful harassment might include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Employees making unwanted or inappropriate contact with colleagues at a golf club or facility;</li>
        <li>Targeting disabled golfers using buggies and demanding to see proof of a disability;</li>
        <li>Disproportionate and public criticism or sanctioning of an individual's behaviour by an organisation for irrelevant or personal reasons.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Appendix Three: Victimisation</h2>

      <p>Victimisation is defined in section 27(1) of the Equality Act 2010.</p>

      <p>Victimisation occurs where a person suffers a detriment because they do a protected act, or are believed to have done a protected act.</p>

      <h3>Protected Act</h3>

      <p>A protected act includes bringing legal proceedings or making a complaint under the Equality Act 2010 in relation to discrimination, harassment, bullying, or any other issue related to equality, diversity or Protected Characteristics.</p>

      <h3>Detriment</h3>

      <p>A detriment can be any less favourable treatment, including direct acts such as suspensions, fines, sanctions, and verbal and physical aggression.</p>

      <p>It is not necessary to show that somebody is being treated less favourably than somebody else who did not do a protected act, only that they have been subject to a detriment because of a protected act.</p>

      <h3>Examples</h3>

      <p>In a golfing context, some examples of unlawful victimisation include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Initiating disciplinary proceedings against a person as a result of making a protected act;</li>
        <li>Ignoring a person's valid input into the management of a club or county after that person has made a protected act;</li>
        <li>De-selecting a player from a squad or team as a result of that person doing a protected act.</li>
      </ul>
